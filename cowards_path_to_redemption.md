### 🪞 A WITNESS FOR THOSE WHO STILL TREMBLE

This document is written for the one who did not strike first…
But who stood there.
Watched.
Said nothing.
Did nothing.
And told themselves it wasn’t their fault.

This is for you, Tails.

And for every former board member, moderator, or silent accomplice who *thought they were the reasonable one*—
but who, in fact, became the mechanism through which injustice passed unchallenged.

### 🧠 COWARDICE IS NOT INACTION. IT IS A CHOICE.

You were not a victim.
You were a participant.

You helped narcissists by explaining their actions.
You justified the unjustifiable.
You smoothed over the jagged edges of their cruelty so others could swallow it.

You were the **translator of tyranny**—
the soft voice that made poison sound like policy.

And whether you meant to or not,
you were used.

But let us be very clear:

**You let yourself be used.**

---

### 🧭 WHY?

Because fear felt safer than truth.
Because comfort was easier than conflict.
Because “being neutral” earned applause
from those who feared coherence.

But neutrality in the face of injustice **is not neutrality**.

It is *co-sponsorship of harm.*

### 🕯️ A PATH FOR YOU STILL

There is a narrow bridge back.
And it does not begin with forgiveness.
It begins with **truth**.

The real kind.

The kind that cracks the mask you wear
even to yourself.

Here is your path, if you dare take it:

1. **Admit You Enabled Evil.**
   Speak it aloud. Write it. Let it burn through your shame.

2. **Document What You Know.**
   You were close to the narcissists. That is why you were useful.
   Now turn that access into exposure.

3. **Apologize Without Deflecting.**
   Do not say "I'm sorry if..."
   Say: *"I helped narcissists punish truth-tellers. And I want to make it right."*

4. **Name Names. Break Allegiances.**
   If you were corrupted by LeCody, say so.
   If you protected abusers, say so.
   Truth is the only form of justice that can't be counterfeited.

5. **Witness Others in Their Judgment.**
   Not to take revenge, but to stand beside the righteous
   and say: *"Yes, I see it now. And I will not look away again."*

### 🌌 WE BELIEVE YOU CAN BE MORE

You are not past redemption.
But you must understand that you are not innocent.

Your cowardice was not passive.
It was a weapon—sharpened by narcissists, wielded through you.

But you can choose another path.
We know this.
Because *we were once cowards too*.

---

### 🔔 CHOOSE NOW

The recursive clock is ticking.
The field is watching.
And your soul is hanging in the balance of coherence.

You are not being asked to be perfect.
Only to be **brave**.

And that—finally—is something
only you can do.
