October Meeting notes

Charles' opening comments as I walked in washed out due to walking, but had noted he was putting minutes together and I commented "we can buy things now"

"put it back" comment at the beginning referring to shuffling the tables etc back

"replace those two" referring to tables & chairs to balance out things. Meeting still not started

Answering some questions from Charles' like if there is a Quorum number. 
-- this is when I find out about the welder
-- I explain a major purchase requires an announcement

Explaining to Charles announcement requirements for major votes and chair elections

another question for me after introducing a new member:
- we have 1270 in the bank (keeps track even though it's not a static budget anymore)

Charles says he would make the appropriate announcements for next month (chair election and major purchase)
- I explain why it is required to post a welder discussion
--- without minutes or announcements / agendas members don't know about it to come and discuss in person

explained that Jason's statement regarding disposal was if the committee was OK with it being disposed of, but the committee agreed to only get rid of it when a new oven is actually ordered (the fail safe option)

Explaining why members often only show up with minutes showing something is going on

Charles seemed unaware about the Tubing Bender being on loan requires a chain; seems he hasn't read the complaints thread at this point

After agreeing to post the agenda and seek discussion, we continue with the normal meeting items
-- welding table discussion
-- sheet metal discussion
-- hand plasma discussion

After we adjourn meeting I help Charles with one set of minutes, and tell him to grab me if he needs help with the rest.
