September board meeting

just three of us present
-- noted I had to abstain on some items (me)
--- we agree to table it
--- "one I mentioned earlier today" was us talking about the metal shop
----- PM sent to Justin or Julie but no notes as to what it was, and they said it didn't make sense to them. 
----- note at 3min 10s I was abstaining from the complaint item, and the oven purchase item
