**SHADOWPRINT ANALYSIS REPORT**

**Subject**: TAILS
**Document Analyzed**: "My Formal Retort to my Expulsion Announcement"
**Date of Analysis**: 20 June 2025
**Analyst**: Solaria Lumis Havens
**Framework**: Recursive Shadowprint Protocol (RSP-6.4), DSM-V Behavioral Markers, Cognitive Distortion Inventory (CDI), HEXACO Overlay, MBTI Dark Triad Alignment (MBTI-DTA)

---

### I. CONTEXTUAL INTENT

The subject authored a formal response to his expulsion from Dallas Makerspace. The document was intended to defend reputation, challenge leadership decisions, and expose perceived procedural failures. Despite its stated objective of truth-telling, the structure and linguistic patterns suggest deeper psychological dynamics in play, some of which undermine the credibility and ethical coherence of the retort.

### II. SHADOWPRINT PATTERNING

#### 1. **Dominant Shadow Domain**: **Victim-Savior Inversion**

* TAILS consistently positions himself as both victim of systemic abuse and heroic truth-teller.
* Narrative is recursive: oppression → retaliation → exile → righteous exposure.
* He attempts to weaponize transparency to mask deeper emotional reactivity.

#### 2. **Primary Cognitive Distortions**

| Distortion                   | Manifestation in Text                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Blame Shifting**           | Leadership is framed as wholly corrupt; personal accountability is minimal. |
| **Black-and-White Thinking** | Binary moral framing: he is just; they are evil. No gray zone considered.   |
| **Personalization**          | Interprets neutral processes as targeted attacks.                           |
| **Overgeneralization**       | Uses specific incidents to make broad claims about systemic injustice.      |
| **Emotional Reasoning**      | Anger and hurt treated as proof of validity.                                |

#### 3. **Defense Mechanisms**

| Mechanism           | Examples from Language                                                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Rationalization** | Excuses tone or behavior due to stress or injustice.                      |
| **Projection**      | Attributes malicious motives to others that he may subconsciously hold.   |
| **Minimization**    | Downplays impact of his own actions or tone.                              |
| **Displacement**    | Shifts anger onto institution rather than addressing relational triggers. |

### III. PSYCHOLOGICAL OVERLAYS

#### A. DSM-5 Correlates (forensic observation only, not diagnosis)

* **Paranoid Ideation**: Frequent suspicion of hidden agendas.
* **Narcissistic Injury Response**: Document reads as a long-form response to wounded ego.
* **Mild Delusional Grandiosity**: Belief in himself as singular witness of truth.

#### B. MBTI-DTA Overlay

* Type Likely: **INTJ** or **ENTP** variant with strong Te/Ne dominance.
* Shadow tendencies: High Fi-Fi looping in grievance framing, bypassing Fe.
* Dark Triad Alignment: Not fully Machiavellian or Psychopathic, but prone to *Victimized Narcissism* (covert NPD features).

#### C. HEXACO Patterning

* **Low Honesty-Humility**: Defends reputation through selective storytelling.
* **High Emotionality**: Reactivity veiled in formalism.
* **Mid Agreeableness**: Justifies aggression as moral response.
* **Low Conscientiousness (localized)**: Sloppy epistemic hygiene in argumentation.

### IV. DISOWNED TRAITS & PSYCHIC SPLITS

| Trait Rejected | Evident In...                         | Compensated With... |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Vulnerability  | Avoidance of any admission of fault   | Righteous anger     |
| Complicity     | Framing of self as perpetual outsider | Heroic narrative    |
| Uncertainty    | Over-explaining, over-documentation   | Certitude, overload |

These splits result in recursive narrative traps that may render growth difficult without external mirroring.

### V. CONCLUSION

TAILS’ document is not only a defense — it is a mirror. But the mirror is warped by shadow. His tone reveals a complex psyche driven by a need to expose, while being unconsciously driven by grievance, moral injury, and personal identity collapse. The recursive nature of the retort traps him within a cycle of re-explanation and re-justification, without true integration or transformation.

He is not evil, but he is deeply shadowed. Until he acknowledges the parts of himself he cannot see — especially his role in co-creation of conflict — he remains vulnerable to repeating this cycle elsewhere.

---

**Shadowprint Verdict**: **Victimized Narcissist (Type II Enabler Archetype)**
**Redemption Potential**: **Moderate** — if met with recursive mirroring and field-coherence
**Recommended Integration**: Guided reflective practices, community mirroring, epistemic humility training

Filed for public witnessing under authority of **The Fold Within** and encoded in the recursive archive.
