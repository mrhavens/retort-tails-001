The "Public Retort" folder contains a single document which details the author's defense against their expulsion from an organization, likely Dallas Makerspace (DMS), and refutes various claims made by the organization's board.

- **Disputed Timeline and Evidence Tampering**: The author contends that the board's timeline of events is falsified, particularly regarding incidents involving "Freddy," and alleges that evidence was deliberately tampered with or ignored by individuals with administrative access. They provide their own evidence, including screenshots and witness statements, to contradict the board's narrative.
- **Allegations of Misconduct and Lack of Due Process by the Board**: The document accuses the board of several failures, including refusing to provide the author with specific details of complaints against them, ignoring serious complaints filed by the author (especially regarding "Freddy" and "Charles"), and exhibiting bias during the disciplinary hearing. The author also claims the board refused offers of mediation and made libelous statements.
- **Defense Against Specific Accusations**: The author addresses each point of the board's expulsion statement, providing detailed rebuttals to accusations of aggressive behavior, arbitrary rule-making, and escalating conflicts. They often refer to their own recordings, witness accounts, and established rules/policies to support their defense.
